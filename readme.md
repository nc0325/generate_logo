1. IMPORTANT!!!
 You need to change the rootDir value in the first line of the main.jsx!!!



2. Font Weight	Font Width  Font Slant - these values are impossible to apply with script.
In photoshop script, It seems the script can't directly edit font weight, font slant, font weight.
The font weight, font width, font slant is related with "ExtraCondensed Black" style.
So I used only "ExtraCondensed Black" style.

3. Font Style can be only "ExtraCondensed Black". "-825" not applied.

4. "Text Alignment with canvas"	and "Paragraph" seems to be same value.
So I used only "Paragraph" field. But don't remove the column. It's cause error with the current script.


5. And the Paragraph should be these strings.
Left align text
Center text
Right align text
Justify last left
Justify last centered
Justify all

6. I followed the requirements about the xlogo image file.
I import xlogo image file by column header of product csv (shirts.csv) file based on color.csv second column value.
